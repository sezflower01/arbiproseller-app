    title: "Adaptive Cooldowns & Timing",
    color: "teal",
    content: [
      "The engine doesn't change prices constantly. It uses a 5-tier adaptive cooldown system based on your current position: winning, losing close, losing wide, suppressed, or holding.",
      "Anti-flip direction cooldowns prevent back-and-forth pricing. But urgent corrections — like being significantly overpriced — bypass cooldowns immediately.",

      "The engine learns from outcomes. It tracks which price changes won the Buy Box, which raises held, and which drops were unnecessary — then adapts its behavior over time.",
      "An AI review system analyzes decision patterns twice daily and suggests tuning improvements. All changes require manual approval — safety-critical values are never auto-tuned.",

      "When Amazon suppresses the Buy Box (no winner shown), most repricers panic. This system anchors to the lowest filtered competitor and applies controlled micro-undercuts.",
      "A Raw Competition Override ensures you maintain the lowest position even in suppressed markets. The engine doesn't chase ghost prices — it targets real, active competitors.",

                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  Most repricing tools do one thing: if someone lowers their price, you match it. That's not intelligence — that's a spreadsheet formula.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">
                  A real repricing system needs to understand <strong className="text-white">when to lower</strong>, <strong className="text-white">when to raise</strong>, <strong className="text-white">when to hold</strong>, and <strong className="text-white">when to do nothing</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80">
                  It needs to protect your margins, adapt to market changes, learn from outcomes, and work across multiple marketplaces — all without you watching it 24/7.
