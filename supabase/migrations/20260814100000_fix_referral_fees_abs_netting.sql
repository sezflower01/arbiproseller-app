-- Fix referral_fees aggregation in get_pl_live_summary / get_monthly_pl_breakdown
--
-- Both functions aggregated every fee column as SUM(ABS(x)) -- absolute
-- value taken PER ROW, before summing. That's safe for columns where every
-- row always carries the same sign, but referral_fees doesn't: shipment
-- rows hold the gross commission as a positive magnitude, while refund
-- rows hold Amazon's post-hoc referral-fee adjustments as a SIGNED value
-- (fetch-profit-loss/index.ts's processRefundEventToCache: negative when
-- Amazon credits part of the commission back to the seller on a return --
-- the common case -- positive on the rarer admin-fee-kept case). Taking
-- ABS() of each row before summing flips every credit-back row from
-- negative to positive, turning a real reduction in referral fee expense
-- into a phantom ADDITIONAL expense.
--
-- Confirmed against live 2026 data and raw SP-API ListFinancialEvents for
-- sampled orders: our per-order fee capture is correct, but this
-- aggregation bug was inflating total referral_fees by $25,098.92
-- account-wide, all-time, all marketplaces (the only fee column affected --
-- verified no other fee column has refund rows with negative values in
-- this account's real data, since Amazon's own policy is to credit back
-- referral fee on returns but not FBA fulfillment fees). This bug predates
-- the FX-conversion fix (present already in 20260728210000_pl_fx_conversion.sql),
-- not introduced by it.
--
-- Fix: sum the signed value first, then take ABS() of the net total
-- (ABS(SUM(x)) instead of SUM(ABS(x))) -- so a credit-back row correctly
-- offsets the gross charge instead of adding to it, while still keeping a
-- non-negative result for the fee total.
--
-- No other fee column is touched: confirmed live that referral_fees is the
-- only one with refund-side rows carrying a negative value, so changing
-- the others would be a no-op today and is left alone to keep this change
-- minimal.
